<h4>The Pink Porsche Taycan: An Interior as Beautiful as The Exterior</h4>
<p>The color we’re talking about on the pink Porsche Taycan is actually called Frozen Berry Metallic shade.</p>
<p>It’s a pinkish, steely rose paint color that gives the Porsche Taycan a rather feminine but somehow edgy look. And it’s very popular.</p>
<p>And it’s a nice break from most of the car colors on the road: white, brown, blue, and so forth</p>
